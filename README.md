# Noiselesshorn
The Noise-Free Vehicular Horn system utilizes wireless transmission of modulated signals to produce a low-decibel beep sound near the steering, eliminating irritation to others. An external horn emitting around 63dB is available for urgent situations, ensuring safety without causing discomfort to pedestrians crossing carelessly.
